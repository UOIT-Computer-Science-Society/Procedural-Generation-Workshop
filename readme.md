# Procedural Generation Workshop
## In this workshop, we'll be programming an algorithm that can be used to create a dungeon

### Compileing
You need to be able to compile Java source code for this workshop. You can install OpenJDK here.
> https://openjdk.java.net/

Once you download the repository and installed java, navigate to the folder in your command line and compile the java files
>javac BSPTree.java

>javac ImageCreator.java

>javac Driver.java

The other java files aren't implemented yet so they may not compile.
### Running
Finally, you need to run the java files
>java Driver

If it runs successfuly, an image called "grid.png" will appear in the folder. It will look like this:

![grid](./examples/Example.png)
